			<h1>Lucia Hughes</h1>
			<h2>3rd Year Game Programmer @ Champlain College</h2>

			<p>Hi, I'm Lucia. I am a game programmer who is a generalist in the sense that I can't pick a favorite, because I love pretty much every area of programming.
				Taking on new challenges is always a personal goal for me on every project that I am a part of. I am very passionate about learning and trying new techniques.</p>
			<p>I have experience working on both solo and collaborative projects. I am a strong team player, and I have received lots of positive feedback, both for my contributions and my critique.</p>
			<p>I have the most experience in Unity / C#, but I am also well acquainted with Unreal and C++.</p>
			<p>I am very passionate about making games, especially ones with creative gameplay design and ones that intend to have an emotional impact on its players. 
				Even though programming is my focus, I greatly enjoy contributing to design conversations as well.</p>
